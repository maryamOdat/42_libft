### Libft - My Foundational C Library  

Libft is a project I developed as part of my journey at 42 Amman. It’s a custom C library where I recreated and extended standard C library functions, focusing on modularity, efficiency, and reliability. This library is a toolkit that handles common tasks like string manipulation, memory management, and more.  

#### What I’ve Achieved:  
1. **Recreating Standard Functions**:  
   I implemented functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strncmp`, and `ft_memcpy` from scratch, ensuring they meet the standards of the C library while maintaining clean and efficient code.  

2. **Memory Management**:  
   Functions like `ft_memmove` and `ft_memset` are designed to handle edge cases and ensure stability in diverse use cases.  

3. **String Manipulation**:  
   I wrote functions such as `ft_strlcpy`, `ft_strmapi`, and `ft_itoa`, offering flexible solutions for handling and transforming strings.  

4. **Utility Functions**:  
   To make the library more versatile, I added functions like `ft_atoi`, `ft_strchr`, and `ft_substr`, enhancing its usability for a variety of programming tasks.  

#### Highlights of the Development Process:  
- **Modularity**:  
  I structured the library so that each function is self-contained, making it easy to understand and integrate.  

- **Edge-Case Handling**:  
  A lot of effort went into anticipating and managing edge cases, ensuring the functions are robust and reliable.  

- **Testing**:  
  I tested my code rigorously with custom inputs and edge cases to ensure every function works as expected.  

- **Makefile**:  
  I created a `Makefile` that compiles the library into `libft.a`, making it simple to include in other projects.  

This project has been a significant step in my growth as a programmer. It taught me the importance of attention to detail, modular design, and robust testing. Libft is not just an academic exercise—it’s a library I’m proud to have built and one that I can use as a foundation in future projects.
